Go to [Theory.md](https://github.com/rodrickcalvin/Musical-note-identifier-Chromatic-tuner/blob/master/Theory.md) to get the indepth explanation of the theory behind the system.

## After:
- Clone the project to your local computer.
- Install the following packages
  > ### For GUI:
  > Choose your favorite GUI library to build. The options are:
  > - Kivy
  > - KivyMD
  > - PyQT
  > - tKinter

   !!! Disclaimer: Choose wisely considering ease of use and quality output...
  > ### For the logic and backend:
  > Take note to always use a python version compatible with the libraries. We use python version 3.6 because pyAudio wouldn't install on later versions of python 3.7+.
  > - Create a virtual environment using virtualenv or virtualenvwrapper
  > - If using windows make sure your visual c++ and build tools are installed. Hence you may need to have visual studio installed on your computer.
  > - activate your environment:
  > ```"myenv\Scripts\activate"``` for virtualenv and ```"workon myenv"``` for virtualenvwrapper.
  > - install the requirements needed for the project:
  > ```"pip install --user -r requirements.txt"```
  > - Run the ```multithreading.py``` file.

  ## Contributions:
  You are welcome to contribute to this project. We developed it during a process to find a solution to an assignment in the course: ```Audio and Speech Signal Processing``` under the Computer Engineering undergraduate programme at university.

  We were asked to develop a simple audio processing application using what we had learnt. And so we came up with the idea as a small project.

  > A big shoutout [Matt Zucker](https://github.com/mzucker) from Philadelphia for the repository that guided us through the creation of this application.....
